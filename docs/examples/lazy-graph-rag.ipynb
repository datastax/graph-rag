    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In [LazyGraphRAG](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/lazygraphrag-setting-a-new-standard-for-quality-and-cost/), Microsoft demonstrates significant cost and performance benefits to delaying the construction of a knowledge graph.\n",
    "This is largely because not all documents need to be analyzed.\n",
    "However, it is also benefical that documents by the time documents are analyzed the question is already known, allowing irrelevant information to be ignored. \n",
    "\n",
    "We've noticed similar cost benefits to building a document graph linking content based on simple properties such as extracted keywords compared to building a complete knowledge graph.\n",
    "For the Wikipedia dataset used in this notebook, we estimated it would have taken $70k to build a knowledege graph using the [example from LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/graph_constructing/#llm-graph-transformer), while the document graph was basically free.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we demonstrate how to populate a document graph with Wikipedia articles linked based on mentions in the articles and extracted keywords.\n",
    "Keyword extraction uses a local [KeyBERT](https://maartengr.github.io/KeyBERT/) model, making it fast and cost-effective to construct these graphs.\n",
    "We'll then show how to build out a chain which does the steps of Lazy GraphRAG -- retrieving articles, extracting claims from each community, ranking and selecting the top claims, and generating an answer based on those claims."

Additionally, Bermuda sloops were constructed using Bermuda cedar, a material valued for its durability and resistance to rot, contributing to the ships' longevity and performance (Source: 17186373).

    "\n",
    "This post demonstrated how easy it is to implement Lazy GraphRAG on top of a document graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "It used `langchain-graph-retriever` from the [graph-rag project](datastax.github.io/graph-rag) to implement the document graph and graph-based retrieval on top of an existing LangChain `VectorStore`.\n",
    "This means you can focus on populating and using your `VectorStore` with useful metadata and add graph-based retrieval and even Lazy GraphRAG when you need it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Any LangChain `VectorStore` can be used with Lazy GraphRAG without needing to change or re-ingest the stored documents.**\n",
    "Knowledge Graphs and GraphRAG shouldn't be hard or scary.\n",
    "Start simple and easily overlay edges when you need them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph retrievers and LazyGraph RAG work well with agents.\n",
    "You can allow the agent to retrieve differently depending on the question -- doing a vector only search for simple questions, traversing to mentioned articles for a deeper question or traversing to articles that cite this to see if there is newer information available.\n",
    "We'll show how to combine these techniques with agents in a future post.\n",
    "Until then, give `langchain-graph-retriever` a try and let us know how it goes!"
