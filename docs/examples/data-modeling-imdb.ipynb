    "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) – using vector similarity search to\n",
    "retrieve semantically relevant information – is great. It is easy to implement\n",
    "and provides great results for many questions. However, as great as it is there\n",
    "are cases where it breaks down and advanced RAG techniques may be needed:\n",
    "* Complex questions needing information about multiple topics may require question rewriting or an agent based approach.\n",
    "* Broad questions may need multiple perspectives, and benefit from techniques like MMR to retrieve a diverse set of results.\n",
    "* Deep questions may require explanations and clarifying information for the retrieved context, benefitting from knowledge graphs and/or agent techniques asking follow-up questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowledge graphs linking between content solve these problems. Graph RAG lets\n",
    "us start with vector similarity to address a wide variety of questions. As\n",
    "vector similarity breaks down, links between documents can be traversed to\n",
    "retrieve deeper information and handle more complex questions. Graph traversal\n",
    "techniques like MMR can be used to retrieve a diverse set of contexts also helps\n",
    "with broad questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "By enabling these graph traversals using metadata in the vector store, Graph RAG allows you to solve these problems without re-ingesting your data. At retrieval time, documents may be linked to other documents based on properties stored in the metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this article, we’ll see how easy it is to use an existing vector store as a graph vector store. We'll understand the kind of information that may be useful to have in the metadata to support these traversals.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What to link\n",
    "When first upgrading a vector store to a GraphVectorStore, the question of what to link naturally arises. Since vector similarity does such a great job of capturing semantic similarity based on the content the best use of links is to capture relationships that may not be readily apparent from the content alone. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In a legal document you could create links from paragraphs to definitions of relevant terms.\n",
    "1. In a technical support knowledge base you could link to more specific steps for each suggested procedure.\n",
    "1. In an article, you could link a paragraph of text to an image that illustrates the concept.\n",
    "1. In a travel application you could link a hotel to nearby attractions in the same metropolitan area.\n",
    "\n",
    "In all of these cases, the links provide additional information that is not semantically related to the original content. They are the kinds of things that you might link to if you were writing a webpage or look for in a follow-up search when performing deeper research. Often, this information is available in your existing API or database and just needs to be added to the retrieval system."
