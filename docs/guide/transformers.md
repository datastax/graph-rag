# Document Transformers

!!! note "Transformers are optional, not mandatory"

    Graph traversal operates on the structured metadata.
    Document transformers provide tools for populating the metadata, but they are not necessary.
    In many cases you may have existing structred information that is useful in addition or instead of what the transformers would populate.
