## Development

### UV

This project is managed with [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)

Make sure you have > 0.5.0 of UV installed.

* Use `uv python install` to install the project python version
* Use `uv sync` to install the dependencies into a virtual environment

## Helpers

There is a Makefile with some standard commands:

### Linting

* `uv run poe fmt` Uses Ruff to format all code
* `uv run poe check` Uses Ruff to check all code
* `uv run poe fix` Uses Ruff to check and attempt to fix all code
* `uv run poe mypy` Runs the Mypy static type check.

`uv run poe lint`: Does `fmt`, `fix`, and `mypy` in a single command

### Testing

* `uv run poe integration` Run integration tests
* `uv run poe unit` Run unit tests

## Releasing

1. Look at the [draft release](https://github.com/datastax/graph-rag/releases) to determine the suggested next version.
2. Create a PR updating the following locations to that version:
  a. [`pyproject.toml`](https://github.com/datastax/graph-rag/blob/main/pyproject.toml#L3) for `dewy`
  b. [`dewy-client/pyproject.toml`](https://github.com/datastax/graph-rag/blob/main/dewy-client/pyproject.toml#L3) for `dewy-client`
  c. API version in [`dewy/config.py`](https://github.com/datastax/graph-rag/blob/main/dewy/config.py#L69)
  d. `openapi.yaml` and `dewy-client` by running `poe extract-openapi` and `poe update-client`.
3. Once that PR is in, edit the draft release, make sure the version and tag match what you selected in step 1 (and used in the PR), check "Set as a pre-release" (will be updated by the release automation) and choose to publish the release.
4. The release automation should kick in and work through the release steps. It will need approval for the pypi deployment environment to publish the `dewy` and `dewy-client` packages.
